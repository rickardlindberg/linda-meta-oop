Here I intent to explore some ideas inspired by Alan Kay.

The programming environment I intend to explore is a cross between META II,
Linda, and (what I imagine would be) a more appropriate OOP environment.

In [Joe Armstrong & Alan Kay - Joe Armstrong interviews Alan
Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY) Alan talks about the
connection between Linda and META II. I also made the connection that a
Linda-like environment could be the base for a more biological, OOP environment
where objects can react based on messages in their surroundings.
